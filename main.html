	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Time complexity</strong> refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, meaning they execute quickly even for large inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Space complexity</strong> measures the memory (space) required by an algorithm. For example, if an algorithm uses an array of size n, its space complexity is O(n). The term <b>Space Complexity</b> is often used to emphasize this concept.
